
**motionEye** is a web-based frontend for `motion <https://motion-project.github.io>`_. Check out the `wiki <https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye/wiki>`_ for more details. Changelog is available on the `releases page <https://github.com/ccrisan/motioneye/releases>`_.

Due to personal reasons `Calin Crisan <https://github.com/ccrisan>`_ can no longer be actively involved with this project. It has been transferred to the new `motioneye-project <https://github.com/motioneye-project>`_ GitHub organization with a new `developer team <https://github.com/orgs/motioneye-project/people>`_. Please check out the `dev <https://github.com/motioneye-project/motioneye/tree/dev>`_ branch for current development, which includes:

- Migration to Python 3
- Internationalization
- Migration to setuptools
- Many more bug fixes and enhancements

The original code is maintained in the `python2 branch <https://github.com/motioneye-project/motioneye/tree/python2>`_ and bug fixes may be backported if there is still a need for a Python 2 compatible version of motionEye.
